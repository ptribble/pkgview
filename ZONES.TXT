Solaris zones confuse pkgview somewhat:

/var/sadm/system/admin doesn't contain .clustertoc or CLUSTER files, so
anything referencing clusters doesn't work. That includes the tree view
in the main gui, anything to do with jumpstart profiles, and the
clustersizes and metaclustersizes subcommands.

/var/sadm/patch doesn't even exist, so getting hold of the list of
available patches won't work.

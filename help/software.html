<h1>Solaris Package Viewer</h1>

<p>The Package Viewer allows you to study the SVR4 packages
installed on your system.</p>

<p>There are 4 available views:
<ul>
<li>The Package list shows the packages installed, initially in
alphabetical order of package name, although you can change the sort
order using the column headers.</li>
<li>The Tree View shows the packages sorted into clusters in the way
that the installer handles them.</li>
</ul>
Both the above views give general information on the package, the other
packages it depends on and which depend on it, and which install
clusters and metaclusters the package is part of.
<ul>
<li>The Filesystem view allows you to browse the filesystem and see
which packages and install clusters contain a file.</li>
<li>The Patches view allows you to see what patches are installed on
your system, and get some information about those patches.</li>
</ul>
</p>

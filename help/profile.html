<h1>Jumpstart Profile Builder</h1>

<p>The jumpstart profile builder is a graphical utility to select
packages for a jumpstart profile.</p>

<p>On the first screen, you must select a starting metacluster, which
defines the initial set of packages which you can then customize.</p>

<p>On the package selection tab, you can view packages either
alphabetically or hierarchically by cluster.</p>

<p>When viewing a package or cluster, going to the 'Customize' tab
allows you to modify which software would be installed by the jumpstart
profile.</p>

<p>When you're satisfied, go to the 'Output' tab, where you can show
the profile that you've created, and save it to a file.</p>
